# The Consumer Dispatcher Project

Consumer Dispatcher works as a proxy between [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/) and your consumers. Let you scale out and maintain consumers easily.

It provides:
- managing consumers of different queues separately
- serving queues for multiple sites with one instance
- avoid blocking consuming queues
- adding/reducing number of consumers on the fly by clicking a button
- load balance between consumers
- purging queues by clicking a button
- separating bad jobs from good ones in a queue and logging bad jobs to files
- statistics
- master - slave modle
- adding more instance on the fly
- etc.

It can work with all http-based interfaces written in any language. 

[The NetCircle](www.thenetcircle.com) has been using it for more than 18 months. It helps us to consume more than 6 million(the amount depends on your businsess type. Consumer Dispatcher wont be your bottleneck) jobs per day with around 25M memory and 2%cpu usage.
